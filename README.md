# Car-Data-Analysis-IN-Cars-

This repository contains a Car Data Analysis project that explores and analyzes car-related data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The analysis covers various aspects of car sales, including Selling Price, Present Price, Mileage (Kms Driven), and other factors to derive insights about car values, depreciation rates, and market trends.

Project Overview
In this project, we:

Analyze car data to understand how factors like year, price, and mileage affect the car's market value.
Calculate and analyze depreciation rates based on car age and price differences.
Investigate the distribution of car features across different categories (e.g., Transmission Type, Fuel Type).
Use Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Key Features of the Project
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outliers, and data normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between car attributes.
Depreciation Rate Calculation: Formula-based depreciation analysis based on Selling Price and Present Price.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Primary programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for interactive development and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and calculations.
